Stepper_Uart_sample
===================

Using serial communication, it receives message from MONAKA, controls the stepping motor


Using ARDUINO, it controls the stepping motor.
"monaka" receives the character string which is sent from iPhone. 
The signal to which UART of "monaka" becomes the trigger in ARDUINO is sent.

And I could connect to the multiple "monaka" like this.
